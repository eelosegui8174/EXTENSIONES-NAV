# AL Object Designer

C/Side Object Designer was something that the new AL development environment lacks of very much. The idea behind this extension is to provide a main hub for daily development by giving back the ability of overview.

## Main Features

* **List Overview** of all AL objects in your project: based on symbols (*.app) and your local .al files.
* **List Events** from symbol objects, browse them in the same way as objects.
* **Live Update:** object list is automatically maintained as you create/change/delete objects or download symbols.
* **Multi-Folder workspaces** are supported: e.g. a workspace with MainApp/TestApp folders.
* **Object Search**: filter by Object Type, Name or ID.
* **Event Search**: filter by Object Type, Name, ID or Event Name.
* **Copy/Paste Events**: copy event subscription definition to clipboard by clicking on Event Name.
* **Object/Event Name filtering**: works with partial matches as well. Just like the Windows RTC Client's search field.
* **Run** selected objects.
* **Run** table/page **extentions**.
* **View definition of Symbols**: original file is opened for local files.
* **Generate new objects** from tables: card/list pages, report, query.
* **Built-in snippets**: generate new dictionary or entry tables using a single click.
* **Custom snippets**: use your own snippets placed in `<project root>/.altemplates` folder
* **Design view** for Pages (alpha): card/list layout is rendered for local pages. Card/Document Symbols are also supported.

## Requirements

'Run Object' function is based on commands from [CRS AL Language Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waldo.crs-al-language-extension). It's made by Waldo so you should install it anyway. ;)

## VS Commands
* **AL Object Designer**: opens Object Overview
* **AL Page Designer**: opens up Page Designer for currently edited AL Object (Page)

## Page Designer
This extension has a limited ability to view a rendered page layout without deployment, or move existing fields/actions on screen using drag&drop.
Supported page types:
* Card types: Card, Document
* List types: types other than Card/Document are regarded as List

Rendered layout is very similar to Business Central pages, although not an exact copy as I'm not using Office Fabric UI.

## Extension Settings

TODO: this is something I want for future releases. Many options are now hardcoded but should be customizable for the best experience.

## Known Issues

* Design feature works only with pages, the window is empty when selecting page extensions.
* View (Go to definition) is active for all object types, however, it will not work with Control Add-ins for example. 
* Event listing does not include events defined in local objects.
* It might be too bright for dark themes.

## Under the hood
AL Object Designer is a single-page [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/) app that is embedded into a VS Code WebView and exchanges data back and forth.
